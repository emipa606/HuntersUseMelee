#  Hunters Use Melee! 

A small mod that allows hunters to make use of melee weapons to do their job as well as ranged. As simple as that :)

It is also **safe to add or remove from a savegame**. The mod doesn't make lasting changes to the game.

**Now featuring!:** Support for non-weapon hunting (using fists) and for [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=927155256](Simple Sidearms), a mod I highly recommend :) Both are optional and can be enabled in the new mod settings menu.

#  About 

This is a **complete and original reimplementation** of the concept set forth by "Melee Hunting" made by LockdownX7 and maintained by Keeper. 

Keeper's version still uses the old detours method (pre-Harmony method used during Alpha).
This mod however uses Harmony and tries to be as minimal as possible, to run as clean as it can. 

#  Supported Versions and Requirements 

This mod is made for RimWorld 1.1 to 1.3 and requires Harmony 2.x

#  Source Code and Mirror

#  Special Thanks 

Thanks to all the helpful people over at the RimWorld Discord who have helped me a lot.
